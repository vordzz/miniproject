          College is a time of major transition, change, and growth. It can be
          exciting and challenging and, at times, overwhelming, too. The
          stressors of college life may impact your mental health and make it
          difficult to manage daily life and often rigorous academic demands.
          The University Counseling Center (UCC) is here to help. Here, we
          provide a safe, confidential, nonjudgmental space where students can
          explore a wide variety of issues and concerns. Our services include
          crisis intervention, brief consultations, workshops, Drop-In services,
          group and individual counseling, psychiatric care for medication
          management, and referrals to off-campus treatment providers. All UCC
          services are confidential, free, and available to all degree-seeking
          students currently enrolled at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.
